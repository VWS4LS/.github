# Projekt goal
The aim of the project “Administration shell for the wiring harness” (VWS4LS) is the implementation of the administration shell (VWS) for the development, production and assembly of the wiring harness in the automobile. The VWS is a standardized digital twin for the unambiguous representation of any object. The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy is funding this project as part of the 35c economic stimulus package.

## Challenge: Digital consistency of the value chain for the wiring harness
One specific use case for the digital transformation of the automotive and vehicle industry is the wire harness, commonly known as the cable harness. In a way, it is the nervous system of the vehicle, connecting everything together and transmitting all signals. In automotive development and production, the wire harness is one of the most complex and expensive individual components of the vehicle.

There is still a lot of manual work involved in wiring harnesses, and they are manufactured in a wide variety of locations, for example in Europe but also all over the world. This makes disruptions in the supply chain particularly devastating.

In order to make the production of wire harnesses fit for the future, as many process steps as possible must be automated and digitalized. The one is closely linked to the other: Automation is only possible if the description is digitally consistent. And that means along the entire cross-manufacturer value chain. Reliable communication mechanisms that benefit all stakeholders are needed. Ultimately, the aim is to make development, production and assembly simpler and more efficient while maintaining flexibility on the product side. The overriding goal is to be able to produce without human intervention.

An important basis for this is that all machines and processes involved in the value creation process are mapped as interoperable digital twins. The asset administration shell provides the technological basis for this. It ensures that the respective “asset” - this could be a cable, plug, wiring harness, machine or contract - can run through key process steps automatically as an “Industry 4.0 component”. The Industry 4.0 component always consists of the administration shell and an asset. You can think of it as a data cloud around the asset. However, the data is not randomly distributed in there. Instead, there is a structure according to which the data can be stored. The data cloud and asset are conceptually linked. The asset administration shell is not just a static digital representation. It also contains functions that can be used to control, combine, cooperate and implement.
